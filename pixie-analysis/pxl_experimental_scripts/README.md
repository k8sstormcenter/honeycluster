# STIX Converter Scratchpad

This folder is just a playground where I tried different ways to convert logs to STIX format using Pixie scripts.

> ⚠️ These files are experiments. The code might be broken, messy, or half-finished. Treat it like a scratchpad.

## What's Inside

* `faked_stix.pxl`: Testing fake STIX outputs.
* `no_func_stxi.pxl`: Early version, no functions yet.
* `scratch.pxl`: Random trial stuff from Pixie UI.
* `transform_stix.pxl`: A more structured attempt at STIX conversion.
* `lightening_rod (Reference).py`: Some reference or helper Python code.

## Note

This is not meant to be production-ready. It’s just a place to explore ideas before moving to the main pipeline.

Use freely, break things, test ideas.
